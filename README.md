# Middleware
In Express.js, `app.use()` is a method used to mount middleware functions in the application's request processing pipeline. Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. They can perform various tasks such as modifying request and response objects, ending the request-response cycle, and calling the next middleware in the stack.

The `app.use()` function is versatile and can be used to apply middleware to every route in the application or to a specific route or path. It takes a callback function (middleware function) as its argument.

Here are a few common use cases for `app.use()`:

1. **Setting Up Middleware for All Routes:**
   ```javascript
   // Example middleware for logging requests
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     console.log(`Received a ${req.method} request to ${req.url}`);
     next(); // Call the next middleware in the stack
   });
   ```

   In this example, the middleware function logs information about every incoming request. It is applied to all routes because it is defined using `app.use()` without specifying a specific path.

2. **Using Middleware for a Specific Path:**
   ```javascript
   // Middleware for a specific path
   app.use('/admin', (req, res, next) => {
     // Middleware logic for '/admin' path
     next();
   });
   ```

   This middleware will only be executed for routes that match the specified path (`'/admin'` in this case).

3. **Handling Static Files:**
   ```javascript
   // Serving static files from the 'public' directory
   app.use(express.static('public'));
   ```

   The `express.static` middleware is used to serve static files, such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files. It is mounted using `app.use()`.

4. **Parsing Request Bodies:**
   ```javascript
   // Middleware for parsing JSON and URL-encoded request bodies
   app.use(express.json());
   app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
   ```

   These middleware functions are used to parse JSON and URL-encoded request bodies, respectively.

In summary, `app.use()` is a powerful method in Express.js that allows you to incorporate middleware into your application, enabling you to handle various aspects of the request-response cycle. It's a fundamental part of building robust and modular Express applications.
